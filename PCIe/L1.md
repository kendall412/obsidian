L1 - This state proves greater power savings by trading off a longer recovery time than L0s does. Entry into L1 involves a negotiation between both Link partners to enter it together and can occur in one of two ways:

The first is autonomous with ASPM: hardware in an Upstream Port with no scheduled TLPs or DLLPs to transmit can automatically negotiate to put its Link into the L1 state. If the Downstream Port agrees, the Link enters L1. If not, the Upstream Port will enter L0s instead.
The second is the result of power management software issuing a commanding a device to a lower-power state (D1, D2, or D3hot). As a result, the Upstream Port notifies the Downstream Port that they must enter L1, the Downstream Port acknowledges that, and they enter L1.
