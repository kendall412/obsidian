This state allows a configured Link to be disabled. In this state, the Transmitter is in the Electrical Idle state while the Receiver is in the low impedance state. This might be necessary because the Link has become unreliable or due to a surprised removal of the device. Software commands a device to do this by setting the Disable bit in the Link Control register. The device then sends 16 TS1s with the Disable Link bit set in the TS1 Training Control field.Receivers are disabled when they receive those TS1s.
