n this state the main power to the devices is turned off to achieve a greater power savings. Almost all of the logic is off, but a small amount of power is still available from the Vaux source to allow the device to indicate a wakeup event. An Upstream Port that supports this wakeup capability can send a very low frequency signal called Beacon and a Downstream Port can forward it to the Root Complex to get system attention. Using the Beacon, or a sideband WAKE# signal, a device can trigger a system wakeup event to get main power restored.
