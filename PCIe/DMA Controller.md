In modern computer systems, transferring data between input/output (I/O) devices and memory can slow performance if the CPU manages every step. To overcome this, a Direct Memory Access (DMA) Controller is used. It enables I/O devices to transfer data directly to or from memory without heavy CPU involvement, improving speed and efficiency.

It generates memory addresses and controls timing for efficient data movement.

Once initialized by the CPU, it operates independently to complete the transfer.
