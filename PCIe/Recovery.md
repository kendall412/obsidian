If everything works as expected, the Link trains to the L0 state without ever going into the Recovery state. If the correct Symbol pattern isn’t seen in the Configuration Idle, the LTSSM goes to Recovery in an effort to correct signaling problems by adjusting equalization values. Secondly, once L0 is reached with a data rate of 2.5 GT/s and both devices support higher speeds, the LTSSM goes to Recovery and attempts to change the Link speed to the highest commonly-supported/advertised speed. In this state Bit Lock and either Symbol Lock or Block Alignment is reacquired and the Link is deskewed again. The Link and Lane Numbers should remain unchanged unless the Link width is being changed. In that case, LTSSM passes through the Configuration state where Link width is re-negotiated.
