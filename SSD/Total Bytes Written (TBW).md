Total Bytes Written (TBW) <span style="color: yellow">measures the total amount of data that can be written to a Solid-State Drive (SSD) before its memory cells degrade</span>, serving as a key indicator of lifespan. It is often used to define warranty periods, with higher TBW indicating greater endurance. Users can monitor this metric via S.M.A.R.T. data to predict drive failure and avoid data loss. 

Key Aspects of Total Bytes Written (TBW):
- Definition & Purpose: TBW represents the total terabytes (TB) of data that can be written to an SSD over its lifetime before it becomes unreliable. It acts as a "lifetime mileage" gauge.

- Significance: It measures longevity and is critical for assessing when an SSD might fail. Exceeding this limit increases the risk of data corruption.

- Factors Affecting TBW: The actual lifespan is influenced by the drive's capacity, the NAND flash type (e.g., TLC, MLC), and the Write Amplification Factor (WAF)—the ratio of data written to the flash vs. data sent by the host.

- Measurement: TBW is often monitored via S.M.A.R.T. attributes (e.g., Attribute 241/Total_LBAs_Written).

- Typical Usage: For average users, a 100–200 TBW rating is sufficient, lasting for years. Power users (video editing, 3D rendering) require higher TBW.

- Warranty: It defines the guaranteed minimum endurance for the warranty period (e.g., 3-5 years). 

For example, a drive with a 354 TBW rating can handle 354 terabytes of data written over its lifetime.
